## Getting Started
You'll need the following installed:
- Git
- Node with NPM
### Developing
Set up the development environment like so:
1. Clone this repository.
2. In the repository directory, run `npm ci`.
3. Run `npm run start`.
4. Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Building for Deployment
You can deploy a production ready version of the application by serving the bundle.
1. Clone this repository.
2. In the repostiory directory, run `npm ci`.
3. Run `npm run build`.
4. Serve the `dist` folder as you see fit.

## Development Phases
### Phase 1
The first phase of the project is to be on-par with the exiting WPI Planner. This consists of:
1. Schedule building without conflicts
2. "Favoriting" schedules.
3. View Undergraduate and Graduate courses for a singular academic year, excluding summer courses.
4. Defining time preferences in order to avoid early or late courses.

### Phase 2
The second phase of the project is to augment it with basic improvements. This may require more intense HCI studies. The goals include:
1. Functional mobile support.
2. Support for summer terms.
3. Proper support for multi-year viewing.
4. Workday Schedule Importing (Optional)

### Phase 3
The third phase is the final phase that will involve intense work from the author. The application should achieve production quality stability, testing, and code organization. The project should live in this phase until additional work is planned by other teams.
