        <h3>About</h3>
          <p>This project exists to improve upon the WPI Planner, a webapp created in 2014 by <a href="https://github.com/Nican/wpischeduler">Henrique Polido</a> and maintained primarily by <a href='https://github.com/Jmckeen8/wpiplanner'>Jordyn McKeen</a>.
          Given the age of the project, it was not designed with mobile interfaces in mind, and lacks some critical features for the modern student.
          This project aims to complete three stages:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>To achieve parody with the existing WPI planner, but in a modern and extensible codebase.</li>
            <li>To address critical feature needs that are not possible in the current planner, such as viewing Summer Courses or multiple years at once.</li>
            <li>To enter a maintance mode focusing on fixes and maintance until the project receives a new maintainer.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>As of AY25-26, I am a senior, so my time here is short. I want to leave something that others can continue to build upon and to serve the students for as long as the existing planner has.</p>

        <h3>Current Status</h3>
        <p>At the moment, the application is not fully functional. Working on this inbetween my job and regular classes is difficult. If you wish to contribute, please do so <a href="https://github.com/zenisbestwolf/planner2">here</a>.</p>
